# Machine-Learning-Customers
This is a machine learning project using the Decision Tree algorithm to predict the loyalty of potential customers based on household income, household size, education level, and gender. Trains and tests the data, returns an accuracy score, and makes a prediction with inputted (feel free to change it up!) data on a made up customer.
